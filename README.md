## **Problems That We Are Seeking To Solve** 

### Have you ever felt like the best way to relax after a hard day's work is to just enjoy the waves and surf till your heart's content, so all that stress can just drift away? Yet, whenever you try to go and relieve some of that stress it always seems that the beach just does not have that perfect wave that you need. Well with this app checking the tides is just one click away from finding that perfect wave without the headache of wasting time from catching that perfect wave.


## **Primary Goal**

### We are here to bring a free and easy way for surfers to find their desired beach and see in realtime the waves as well as an accurate forecast of the tides, swell, wind, etc..
